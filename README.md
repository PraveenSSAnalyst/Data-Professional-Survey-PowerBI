# Data-Professional-Survey
Power BI dashboard based on a Data Professional Survey, focusing on fundamental best practices to ensure clarity and efficiency. 

Here’s what I prioritized:

✅ Data Cleaning – Prepared and transformed raw survey data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

✅ DAX Measures – Wrote explicit DAX calculations instead of relying on implicit measures for better control and scalability.

✅ Prompt & Clear Headers – Ensured every visual had concise and meaningful labels for easy interpretation.

✅ Dashboard Development: Focused on key insights ( KPI ) while keeping the design simple and effective.
